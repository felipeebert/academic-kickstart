Hello! Since March of 2020, I started a second postdoctoral period at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/" rel="nofollow">Department of Mathematics and Computer Science</a>, Eindhoven University of Technology (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tue.nl/en/" rel="nofollow">TU/e</a>), working with of Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre" rel="nofollow">Alexander Serebrenik</a>. From March of 2019 to February of 2020, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Informatics Center (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br" rel="nofollow">CIn</a>), Federal University of Pernambuco (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ufpe.br" rel="nofollow">UFPE</a>), along with the Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor" rel="nofollow">Fernando Castor</a>. In 2019 I obtained my PhD degree from CIn-UFPE under supervision of Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor" rel="nofollow">Fernando Castor</a> and Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre" rel="nofollow">Alexander Serebrenik</a>. In 2013 I obtained my master's degree from CIn-UFPE, working under supervision of Prof. <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor" rel="nofollow">Fernando Castor</a>. In 2009 I got my bachelor's degree from CIn-UFPE.
