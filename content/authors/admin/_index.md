Hello! Since March of 2020, I started a second postdoctoral period at the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/), Eindhoven University of Technology [(TU/e)](https://www.tue.nl/en/), working with Dr. [Alexander Serebrenik](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre). From March of 2019 to February of 2020, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Informatics Center [(CIn)](https://www3.cin.ufpe.br/en/), Federal University of Pernambuco [(UFPE)](https://www.ufpe.br), along with the Dr. [Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor).

In 2019 I obtained my PhD degree from CIn-UFPE under supervision of Dr. [Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor) and Dr. [Alexander Serebrenik](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre). In 2013 I obtained my master's degree from CIn-UFPE, working under supervision of Dr. [Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor). In 2009 I got my bachelor's degree from CIn-UFPE.

My research interests are related to how software systems and developers interact with each other. I'm interested in both technical and social aspects of software maintenance, specifically code reviews, mining software repositories, and also social development aspects. In the past, I also have worked with error handling and software energy consumption.

I'm looking for interesting job opportunities in The Netherlands.
